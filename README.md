Web Programming Midterm Homework.
In this assignment, a fake API was used using html, css and javascript. When you first opened the page, there are links above that you could go to, but for now these links open a random site. When registering to the EDUCATION APPOINTMENT FORM, the user must fill in all fields and tick the checkbox, otherwise the submit button will not work and will give an error. Even if the user fills in all the fields, if the user does not enter a correct e-mail in the email section or does not write a real Turkish number starting with +90 in the phone number section, the system will give an error when the submit button is clicked and the submit button will not work. When the user enters all the information correctly and ticks the checkbox, the submit button works and "Form is submitted." is displayed on the screen.  Additionally, if the user wishes, he can click on the text and view the conditions before ticking the Terms and Conditions checkbox.
